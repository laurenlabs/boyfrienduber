BoyfriendUber is a personal project based on a joke between my boyfriend and myself. When complete, this app will allow users to log in, nudge or request a ride, and rate a ride on a star scale of 1-5 with an optional comment.

As a first step, I have added [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
